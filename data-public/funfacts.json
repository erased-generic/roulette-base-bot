  "Toxeus magnus, a type of jumping spider native to Southeast Asia, can produce a nutritious milk-like substance containing about four times as much protein as cow's milk.",
  "Kefir is a drink made from fermented milk, similar to yogurt. Drinking kefir can help with digestion and metabolism in general and bone health. It is also low in lactose, and can improve your lactose digestion and tolerance.",
  "As of August 2024, Twitch has over 140 million monthly active users, while YouTube has 2.70 billion.",
  "Dragonflies see around 200 images per second and have a 360Â° eyesight. Their reaction time is 50 ms, compared to 250 ms for humans. When hunting, dragonflies compute an interception flight path, instead of simply flying towards the current location of the prey.",
  "Autostereograms are 2D images that can be perceived as 3D when viewed in a particular way. By converging your eyes behind the image plane, you can trick your brain into matching different elements of the image, as seen by the left and right eyes, as if they belonged to a single object. The distance between the elements controls the perceived displacement of the object when seen through different eyes, and in turn controls the perceived depth. This illusion is also known as the \"Magic Eye\" illusion because of the book series featuring it.",
  "Normally, humans distinguish color with the use of three classes of cone cells in our retina, which are most sensitive to different parts of the spectrum, usually designated L, M and S for long, medium and short wavelengths respectively (or red, green and blue). This is called trichromacy. The genes for two of the cone photopigments are encoded in the X chromosome, and mutations to those genes can cause a shift in the cones' sensitivity, leading to deficiencies of color vision. Carriers of both a normal and a mutated X chromosome, due to random X chromosome deactivation, can sometimes have a mosaic of four types of cone cells in their retinas. However, it is still unclear whether the brain can make use of this extra color channel to differentiate a wider variety of colors, which would make the person a tetrachromat.",
  "The list of animals that can mimic human speech, besides commonly known parrots, also includes ravens, lyrebirds and apparently a seal.",
  "Stop looking at the screen and do some eye exercises! For example, look at an object at least 20 feet away for 20 seconds.",
  "In acoustics, a beat is a sound produced because of interference of two sounds with similar frequencies (with the difference of up to 30-40 Hz). The effect is purely physical and results in periodically increasing and decreasing volume of the sound, as the waves go in and out of sync. However, when two such sounds are played independently through each ear, the waves don't interact directly, but the effect still can be heard as it happens inside of our brains. This sound illusion is called a binaural beat.",
  "Otoacoustic emission (OAE) is a sound that is generated in your inner ear. One type of otoacoustic emission, distortion-product OAE, can be produced by playing two tones with similar frequencies f_1 and f_2, with the difference in hundreds of Hz. Two most prominent generated tones have frequencies of (2 * f_1 - f_2) and simply (f_2 - f_1). For example, by playing a 650 Hz and a 500 Hz tone, you might also faintly hear a 350 Hz lower tone. The effect can also be physically detected with a microphone placed in the ear canal and can be used as a test for cochlear hearing loss, for example for newborns.",
  "Apparently pigeons can be trained to recognize written words, meaning that they can learn if a word is real or not. Specifically, in one study pigeons were trained to distinguish between 26-58 four-letter English words and fake four-letter combinations with an accuracy of 70%. In the process, pigeons seemed to recognize common two-letter combinations in English when presented with new words, and were more likely to answer correctly based on their presence.",
  "A grid cell is a type of neuron that fires regularly when an animal (humans included) traverses an open area, allowing them to keep track of their location. The firing patterns seem to be based on a hexagonal lattice placed in the environment, and are hypothesised to encode a neural representation of Euclidean space."
